## Experience
### University of Pittsburgh (Aug 2023-December 2024)
Undergraduate Teaching Assistant

I assisted in the following courses: Algorithm and Data Structures, Intro to Computer Programming, and Intermediate Programming. During my time as a UTA, I directed labs and recitations for 20-30 students which allowed me to gain strong communication skills and the ability to explain complex problems. I also held regular office hours, which gave me skills with debugging.

### VineAi (May 2024-September 2024)
Frontend Developer

At VineAi, I worked with a small team of engineers to develop a webapp for patent lawers to make the process of researching patents easier by leveraging AI tools. Because the team was so small, I got to lead the entire development of the UI, which gave me great hands on experience in web development and tools like React.

## Projects:

* Back-End of an Auto-Complete Engine - A Java program suggesting words based on user history.
* Big Ideas in Computing and Information Final Project - A Python project using Pandas to analyze wealth and income inequality in Pittsburgh.
* Fast Food Order System: Developed a Flask server API simulating a fast-food order system. On the customer side, implemented features allowing users to select items from an on-screen menu, view a real-time order summary, input their name into the order, and receive a final order summary page. On the kitchen side, created a screen displaying current unprocessed orders and a button for order deletion upon delivery. Showcasing skills in: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, HTTP requests, Python classes, Flask(routes, templates, models), and
database CRUD operations
* Financial Tracking Web App - A web application that allowed users to track and plan their finances. Using a Spring Boot backend and a Angular JS front end. My team and I also participated in project planning with an Agile workflow. Showcasing skills in software engineering, Java, and TypeScript
* Anomaly Detection System - A team project done for Wolfe LLC where a team of engineers and I collaborated to detect anomalies in packages. Front-end built in Next.js allowing users to visualize data and add new packages to our system. A Springboot RESTful API used to detect anomalies and communicate with the MySQL database and front-end. Showcasing skills in software engineering, React, TypeScript, Java, Springboot, MySQL
